Sets up required libraries (openml, pandas, numpy) and directory structure
Downloads datasets from OpenML using their API:

Can specify how many datasets to download (e.g. n_datasets = 10)
Can filter by task type (classification/regression/all)
Applies basic filters (e.g. minimum instances, features)


For each dataset, extracts two types of information:

Metadata: Basic information like dataset ID, name, number of instances/features, etc.
Meta-features: Detailed characteristics/qualities of the dataset (like class entropy, dimensionality, etc.)


Saves the information in two separate CSV files:

metadata_cache.csv: Contains basic dataset information
meta_features_cache.csv: Contains all dataset qualities and characteristics


Includes caching functionality:

Remembers previously downloaded datasets
Only downloads new datasets when run again
Stores downloaded datasets in a local directory


Includes visualization capabilities to analyze dataset properties:

Dataset size distribution
Feature count distribution
Class distribution (for classification tasks)



The notebook is structured to support meta-learning research by gathering datasets and their characteristics in an organized way.
